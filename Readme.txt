To get started

1. Open EV_charging_PPO.ipynb
2. run all and that's it!


Notes:

The mathematical problem used as a benchmark is written in --> Linear_optimization_simple.ipynb
To access saved model --> PPO_model_2.1f
To access training logs (e.g., for tensorboard) --> PPO_log_2.1f
Alternate reward formulation --> EV_charging_PPO_alt.ipynb
